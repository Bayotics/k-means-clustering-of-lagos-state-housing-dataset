# Exploratory-Analysis-Of-Geolocational-Data
This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for immigrants in  Lagos state Nigeria by classifying accommodation for incoming immigrants on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to selected locations.

# The project consists of the following stages:
Fetch Datasets from kaggle
Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning using Pandas)
Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas)
Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs)
Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn)
Present output on a map. (Using Folium)

# Result after implementation
